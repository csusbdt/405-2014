<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
This course is 100% Web-based with an optional weekly meeting on campus.
All reading material is freely available on the Web.
In addition to the optional weekly meetings,
you can communicate with the class as a whole
by posting to the CSUSB CSE 405 Winter 2014 Google Group.
</p>

</p>
There are no exams; your grade is based on the timely completion 
of a sequence of assignments, which is maintained at the following site.
</p>

<div class="well">https://github.com/csusbdt/405-2014</div>

<p>
You will maintain most of your work in a remote Git repository that I will set up for you.
Only you and I will have access to your repository.
I will evaluate your work by looking at your source code and testing a running instance of your code.
</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<p>
The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of server programming.
Certain topics covered in this course 
are common to all server programming problems, such as
communication protocols, authentication, security, database access, and logging.
Other topics are specific to the development environments of individual projects,
such as Web applications, Git, Android SDK, Javascript, Node.js, and CouchDB.
Therefore, the course encourages the acquisition of knowledge
that is common to all server programming problems while developing specialized skills.
</p>

<p>
The techniques that you learn in this course for building Web applications
can be applied to solve a larger set of programming problems that rely on the
HTTP protocol, including native desktop and mobile applications that
store application state in the cloud and interact with other users and systems.
<p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to develop server-side logic in Javascript using Node.js.</li>
<li>Learn how to use a CouchDB database.</li>
<li>Learn how to create scalable cloud computing services.</li>
<li>Learn common security problems and how to avoid them.</li>
<li>Learn how to use ajax and DOM manipulation to create single-page Web apps.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop Web­based mobile applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Labs/Assignments</h2>

<p>
In this course, you will complete a sequence of assignments.
The assignments involve research, programming and problem solving.
I will grade your performance on programming assignments based on the following criteria.
</p>

<div class="csusbdt-background">
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Readability</h4>
    <p>Is source code well-organized? Have unnecessary variables and
       logic been removed from the code?  Does the indentation and line
       spacing show logical structure?  Is indentation and spacing done
       consistently?  Are concerns separated when possible?  Are the
       responsibilities of components clear and consistently assigned?
       Does the code contain names for variables, functions and classes
       that unambiguously express their purpose in the program?  Are
       comments included when needed? Are superfluous comments omitted?
    </p>
    <p class="text-warning">
      Program readability is important because real-world programs
      are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new functionality.
      For this reason, writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full
      score in this class; you must also write code that is readable by humans.  
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Correctness</h4>
    <p>Has the student correctly solved the problems?  Is the application
       interface and internal documentation free of grammar and spelling errors?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Completeness</h4>
    <p>Has the student met all stated requirements?</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Comprehension</h4>
    <p>Does the student understand the work they submitted? Can the
      student explain the submitted work and answer questions about it?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Timeliness</h4>
    <p>Has the student completed the assignment in a timely manner?
       Were materials submitted by the deadline?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>
You can do all required work in this course using any of the three common operating systems,
Windows, OS X and Linux.
All required software can be downloaded and installed for free.
</p>

<p>
It is probably more convenient to complete the course assignments using a personal computer.
However, computers are available in JB 358 and JB 359 that you can also use.
The open times for accessing these labs is available from the CSE website
or by contacting the CSE main office.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
Each assignment is worth 100 points.  Your score will be computed by dividing the total of all
points earned by the total possible points.  The normal scale will be used to assign a letter grade.

<h2>Students with disabilities</h2>

<p>
If you are in need of an accommodation for a disability in order to participate in this class,
please let me know as soon as possible, and also contact 
<em>Services to Students with Disabilities</em> at UH-183, (909)537-5238.
You are advised to establish a buddy system and alternate in the class
if you require assistance in the event of an emergency. Individuals with disabilities should
prepare for an emergency ahead of time by instructing a classmate and the instructor.
</p>

<h2>Academic Regulations and Procedures</h2>

<p>
See the CSUSB Bulletin of Courses for the University's policies on course withdrawal, cheating,
and plagiarism.
</p>

<h2>Computer Science and Engineering Club</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://cse-club.com/">Computer Science and Engineering Club</a> is a student-run organization that uses a
combination of email and campus meetings to plan events, ask and answer technical questions,
post job and internship openings, and discuss other topics of interest to computing majors at
CSUSB. Club­sponsored events include seminars, workshops, tutoring and fun activities.
