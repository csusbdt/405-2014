<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
This course is 100% Web-based with an optional weekly meeting on campus.
All reading material is freely available on the Web.
In addition to the optional weekly meetings,
you can communicate with the class as a whole
by posting to the CSUSB CSE 405 Winter 2014 Google Group.
</p>

</p>
There are no exams; your grade is based on the timely completion 
of a sequence of assignments, which is maintained on
<a href="http://csusbdt.github.io/405-2014">the course website</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to participate in discussion with other students and me,
you should join the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/405-2014">405-2014 Google group</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will maintain most of your work in a remote Git repository that I will set up for you.
Only you and I will have access to your repository.
I will evaluate your work by looking at your source code and testing a running instance of your code.
I will create this remote repository for you
after you start the first assignment.
</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<p>
The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of server programming.
Certain topics covered in this course 
are common to all server programming problems, such as
communication protocols, authentication, security, database access, and logging.
Other topics are specific to the development environments of individual projects,
such as Web applications, Git, Android SDK, Javascript, Node.js, and CouchDB.
Therefore, the course encourages the acquisition of knowledge
that is common to all server programming problems while developing specialized skills.
</p>

<p>
The techniques that you learn in this course for building Web applications
can be applied to solve a larger set of programming problems that rely on the
HTTP protocol, including native desktop and mobile applications that
store application state in the cloud and interact with other users and systems.
<p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn to use ajax and DOM manipulation to create single-page Web apps.</li>
<li>Learn to develop Web-based mobile applications.</li>
<li>Learn to develop server-side logic in Javascript using Node.js.</li>
<li>Learn to use both documented-oriented and relational databases for server-side persistence.</li>
<li>Learn to deploy mobile and desktop applications using scalable cloud computing services.</li>
<li>Learn to code defensively to avoid common security problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Labs/Assignments</h2>

<p>
In this course, you will complete a sequence of assignments.
The assignments involve research, programming and problem solving.
</p>

<p>
Programs that are incorrect or do not solve the stated problem will lose some or all points.
</p>

<p>
Work that is submitted late will lose some or all points.
</p>

<p>
If you submit copies of other people’s work, you will lose all points for that work.
However, if you work with a partner, you can submit identical programs,
but you need to refer to your partner by
name in a comment at the top of your source code files.
</p>

<p>
Writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full score in this class;
you must also write code that is readable by humans.  Program readability is important because
real­world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new
functionality.  Program readability will be evaluated according to the following set of criteria.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
  Don't use tabs for indentation in your source code in this course.
  Tabs display differently in different viewing and editing tools.
  In general, tabs will degrade readability for some people who read your code,
  especially if you mix tabs with spaces.
  If you want full score on your assignments in this course, you should not use tabs.
  If you are in the habit of pressing tab in your editor
  and want to continue working this way,
  look for an option in your editor to replace tabs with spaces.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>
You can do all required work in this course using any of the three common operating systems,
Windows, OS X and Linux.
All required software can be downloaded and installed for free.
</p>

<p>
It is probably more convenient to complete the course assignments using a personal computer.
However, computers are available in JB 358 and JB 359 that you can also use.
The open times for accessing these labs is available from the CSE website
or by contacting the CSE main office.
</p>

<p>
This course relies on resources that are out of the control of the University,
such as Google Groups, Heroku Web application hosting service, Android developer SDK and other
free resources accessible through the internet.
The University will not provide technical support 
for these resources and the University does not endorse any products which may 
be advertised through these resources.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
Each assignment is worth 100 points.  Your score will be computed by dividing the total of all
points earned by the total possible points.  The normal scale will be used to assign a letter grade.
