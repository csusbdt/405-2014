title: Ajax Assignment
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is 
to learn how to retrieve data 
from the server using ajax.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
Create a directory named <code>ajax</code> 
for the work you do for this assignment. 
At the end of the assignment, 
this folder will contain the following files.
</p>

<ul>
<li>app.html</li>
<li>main.js</li>
<li>root.js</li>
<li>image.js</li>
<li>message.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
You should start the assignment 
by making a copy of all the files from 
<a href="html.html">the HTML assignment</a>. 
This will be the starting point for your work.
</p>

<p>
Read up to and including step 3 of 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started">Ajax - Getting Started</a>. 
Test the example code presented in step 3. 
Do this by adding the code to <em>app.html</em>.  
</p>

<p>
Instead of requesting <em>test.html</em> as in the example code, 
request a resource named <em>message</em>. 
In the server code, return the string <em>hello ajax</em> for requests for <em>/message</em>. 
Create a module named <code>message</code> to handle these requests. 
The message module should resemble the root module 
provided in the <a href="buffers.html">buffers assignment</a> 
because we simply need to return a string of content-type <code>text/plain; charset=UTF-8</code>.
</p>
