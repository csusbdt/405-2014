## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to convert a Web application to a native Android application.  The process for iOS is similar but will not be covered.

This assignment builds on the gift assignment and the following three assignments from [CSE 322 Web Page Programming](https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013).

* [Android 1](https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013/wiki/Android-1)
* [Android 2](https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013/wiki/Android-2)
* [Android 3](https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013/wiki/Android-3)

## Assignment folder

Create a directory named _mobile_ for the work you do for this assignment. A good starting point for this assignment is to copy the contents the _gift_ folder into the _mobile_ folder.

At the end of the assignment, this folder will contain the following files.

* README.md
* createdb.bat (if on Windows) or createdb.sh (if on OS X or Linux)
* ... more to come

## Instructions

Use the technique covered in the 3 Android assignments from CSE 322 to convert the gift application to an Android application.  

Thoroughly test your application with an Android device or the emulator from the Android SDK.  If you use a physical Android device, you will need to determine the IP address of the computer you run the server on, and use this IP address in the client code.  If you use the Android emulator, use IP address 10.0.2.2 in the client code to reach the application server.
