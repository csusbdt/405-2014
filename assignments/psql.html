<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment 
is to learn a little about relational databases
and how to use a relational database 
called <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostqreSQL</a>.
</p>

<p>
This assignment requires research and self-study.
If you get to this assignment early enough,
I can help you solve some of the problems you encounter.
</p>

<p>
Find and do a tutorial to learn the basics
of SQL using the PostgreSQL database.
The tutorial in 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/index.html">the
PostgreSQL documentation</a>
may be sufficient.

<h2>Assignment Folder</h2>

<p>
Create a directory named <em>psql</em> 
for the work you do for this assignment. 
Start this assignment by making a copy of
your solution to the gift assignment.
</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>
You will need to become familiar with the SQL language and 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/index.html">the
PostgreSQL documentation</a>.
Don't get absorbed with learning the advanced features of SQL;
the following are the SQL operations I believe you will need to use.
</p>

<ul>
<li>create a database</li>
<li>delete a database</li>
<li>create a table</li>
<li>insert a new row in a table</li>
<li>get a row of data using a primary key</li>
<li>update a row in a table based on a primary key</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Install PostgreSQL and start it. 
</p>

<p>
There are 2 ways you should interact with the database:
</p>

<ul>
<li>From the command line client <code>psql</code>.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/pg">a PostreSQL driver written for Node.js</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should become familiar with the command line client
because you will use it for debugging and for
writing a database creation script.
You should write a script 
that creates a database called <em>gift</em>
and populate it with the same data used to test the code
you developed for the gift application.
</p>

<p>
Unlike CouchDB, you'll need to use 
<a href="https://npmjs.org/package/pg">a driver written for Node.js</a> 
in order to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
You should use the client pooling feature 
of the driver rather than open and close
a connection with each access to the database.
</p>

<p>
To complete this assignment,
I believe that you only need to modify 
the database creation script and
the <code>db</code> module defined in <em>db.js</em>.
