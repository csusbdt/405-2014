## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to develop mastery of the techniques covered in this course.

This assignment builds on the gems assignment.

## Assignment folder

The starting point for this assignment is the code you developed for the gems assignment.
However, don't work in the gems folder; instead, work in a copy of the gems folder named _gift_.
So, start this assignment by making a copy of your _gems_ folder and name it _gift_.

## Instructions

Extend your gems application (the one with the game screen)
so that users can gift gems to each other.
For simplicity, send only a single gem at a time.
Add the gifting functionality to the application through an additional screen
that the user navigates to.

The gifting screen should have the following 3 controls:

* a text field in which the user enters the id of another user
* a SEND button that when clicked sends one gem to the designated user
* a CANCEL button that exits the screen and returns the user back to the home screen

Review my video to see how the application should work.
