<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is 
to practice applying the source code readability criteria in the syllabus.
This will help you get into the habit of following
patterns that improve the readability of your code.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
Create a directory named <em>code</em> 
in your repository to hold the work for this assignment. 
When you complete this assignment, 
the contents of this folder will be the following.
</p>

<ul>
<li>main.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
The following code is a Node.js program that
prints the first 100 prime numbers.
Place this code in a file named <em>main.js</em>
and verify that it runs as expected.
</p>

<pre>
// This program prints the first 100 prime numbers.

// Return true if n is priime.
function isPrime(n) {
  for (var i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
  if (n % i == 0) return false;
  }
  console.log(n);
  return true;

}

var numberOfPrimesDeleted = 0;
var candidatePrime = 2;
var k = 0;

while (numberOfPrimesDeleted<100) {
        if (isPrime(candidatePrime)) {
                ++numberOfPrimesDeleted;
        }
        // Increment candidatePrime.
        ++candidatePrime;
}
</pre>

<p>
The code given above does not satisfy the readability criteria
stated in the course syllabus.
For this assignment, you should modify <em>main.js</em> to resolve these issues.
When you are done, the resulting code should satisfy all
of the given readability criteria.
</p>

<p>
For your convenience, the readability criteria
in the course syllabus are repeated in the following table.
</p>

<table class="table">

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
  *Don't use tabs for indentation in your source code in this course.
  Tabs display differently in different viewing and editing tools.
  In general, tabs will degrade readability for some people who read your code,
  especially if you mix tabs with spaces.
  If you want full score on your assignments in this course, you should not use tabs.
  If you are in the habit of pressing tab in your editor
  and want to continue working this way,
  look for an option in your editor to replace tabs with spaces.
