title: Git Assignment

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
In this course, you will submit your work by writing files into a
remote Git repository that I set up for you.
In order for me to set up this repository for you,
I need a copy of the public key on your computer that your Git client
program uses when connecting to remote hosts.
</p>

<p>
After I receive this from you, I will create an empty
remote repository for you to push commits into and then
I will send you instructions on how to clone 
this repository onto your local computer.
</p>

<p>
In the top level of this cloned repository, 
you will create a folder for each assignment that you complete.
</p>

<h2>SSH keys and tutorials</h2>

<p>
Follow <a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/centos/blob/master/GIT-SUBMISSION.md">these 
Git submission instructions</a>
to prepare your system for using Git in this course.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
Make sure that you do the reading and tutorials identified at the end of the instructions
while you wait for me to create the remote repository for you.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
After you clone the remote repository,
you will create a folder within it named <em>git</em> to store the results of your work on this assignment.
When you are finished with this assignment, the git folder should contain the following files.
</p>

<ul>
<li>README.md</li>
<li>...files you created for experimentation...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
While you are waiting to receive the clone command from me,
complete <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">the 
TryGit tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p>
After completing the TryGit tutorial, familiarize yourself with
<a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">the documentation for Git</a>
and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">the Git book</a>.
If you want to thoroughly understand Git, you should carefully read 
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals">Chapter 9 on Git Internals</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you receive an email from me with the clone command,
run the command in your home directory.
This will create a folder named <em>405</em> in your home directory.
From this point on, I will refer to this folder by the expression
<em>~/405</em>.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
Tilda <em>~</em> represents a home directory on Unix-like
operating systems such as Linux and OS X.
</p>

<p>
In <em>~/405</em> you will see a file named README.md, 
which contains some instructions
to help you configure git on your system.
</p>

<p>
The file's extension <em>.md</em> stands for <em>markdown</em>,
which is a markup language that's designed to be readable in both raw and interpreted forms.
You can think of it as a lightweight substitute for HTML that many programmers use.
You should read about 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">the Markdown syntax</a>,
because each assignment folder that you create should contain a README.md file.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment, create a folder named <em>git</em> within <em>~/405</em>.
</p>

<p>
In <em>~/405/git</em> create a file README.md that describes the documentation you read
and the experiments that you performed while completing this assignment.
</p>

<p>
Also in <em>~/405/git/README.md</em> add a link to your Code School report card,
which shows that you have completed the Try Git tutorial.
<a href="http://www.codeschool.com/users/csusbdt">Here is my report card</a>.
</p>

<p>
Use the following commands to push changes to your README.md file to your remote repository.
</p>

<pre>
cd ~/405
git add git/README.md
git commit -m "completed git assignment"
git push
</pre>
