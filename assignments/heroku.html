<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment 
is to learn how to deploy a Web application
using the Heroku cloud service platform.
</p>

<p>
This assignment requires research and self-study.
If you get to this assignment early enough,
I can help you solve some of the problems you encounter.
</p>

<p>
I covered deployment to Heroku
in the pre-requisite course 
<a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013/wiki/Heroku">Web Page Programming</a>.
If you did not take this course,
then you will need to put extra time into learning how to deploy onto Heroku.
Even if you did take the course,
there are likely many additional things you need to learn in order
to deploy a version of your gift application to it.
</p>

<h2>Assignment Folder</h2>

<p>
There is no special folder for this assignment.
You will need to create a <em>Procfile</em>,
<em>package.json</em> file, and
<em>node_modules</em> folder
in the root level of your repository.
I also advise to create file <em>.slugignore</em>
to omit unnecessary files from the Heroku application slug.
</p>

<p>
To complete this assignment,
you need a way for your code to distinguish
between local and remote deployments.
I recommend that you set environmental variables
to accomplish this.
You will need to use Node.js's process object to do this,
which was covered in <a href="scope.html">the scope assignment</a>.
