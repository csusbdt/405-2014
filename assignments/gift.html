title: Gift Assignment

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment 
is to develop mastery of all the techniques 
covered in this course.
</p>

<p>
This assignment builds on the gems assignment.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
The starting point for this assignment 
is the code you developed for the gems assignment.
However, don't work in the gems folder; 
instead, work in a copy of the gems folder named <em>gift</em>.
So, start this assignment by making a copy of your <em>gems</em> 
folder and name it <em>gift</em>.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Extend your gems application (the one with the game screen)
so that users can gift gems to each other.
For simplicity, send only a single gem at a time.
Add the gifting functionality to the application through an additional screen
that the user navigates to.
</p>

<p>
The gifting screen should have the following 3 controls:
</p>

<ul>
<li>a text field in which the user enters the id of another user</li>
<li>a SEND button that when clicked sends one gem to the designated user</li>
<li>a CANCEL button that exits the screen and returns the user back to the home screen</li>
</ul>

<p>
Review my video to see how the application should work.
