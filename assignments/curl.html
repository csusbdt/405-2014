<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">the curl command line tool</a> 
to send and receive HTTP messages, 
which is useful for system administration, debugging and research.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
Create a directory named <code>curl</code> for the work you do for this assignment.
At the end of the assignment, this folder will contain the following files.
</p>

<ul>
<li>README.md</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Install <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> 
if you don't already have it.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
I believe curl is built into OS X but not Windows, but I haven't verified this.
</p>

<p>
Read about curl and experiment.
</p>

<p>
View <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a> 
in a browser and then retrieve it using curl.
</p>

<pre>
curl -X GET http://curl.haxx.se/
</pre>

<p>
Curl writes the contents of the HTTP response into its standard output stream,
which you can direct to a file.
</p>

<pre>
curl -X GET http://curl.haxx.se/ > t.html
</pre>

<p>
Now open t.html in your browser.  
In Windows, the following will open t.html in your browser.
</p>

<pre>
start t.html
</pre>

<p>
In OS X, the following will open t.html in your browser.
</p>

<pre>
open t.html
</pre>

<p>
There's probably a way to do it in Linux, 
but I don't know what it is,
and it may vary based on distribution.
</p>

<p>
To look at both headers and message body together, do the following.
</p>

<pre>
curl -X GET http://curl.haxx.se/ -i
</pre>

<p>
To look only at the response headers, do the following.
</p>

<pre>
curl -X GET http://curl.haxx.se/ -I
</pre>

<p>
In README.md, include the headers that are returned by the previous GET request.
