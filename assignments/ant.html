title: Ant Assignment
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to learn about the Apache Ant build system
and one way to set up a build file to build Android applications.
In the next assignment,
you will use the results of this assignment as a basis to 
convert the gift application from a Web application to an Android application.
</p>

<p>
The build process developed in this assignment has the following characteristics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Build operations are done at the command line 
    and do not have any dependencies on Eclipse or other IDE.</li>
<li>Android project generation is part of the normal build process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
Create a directory named <em>ant</em> 
for the work you do for this assignment. 
</p>

<h2>Install the Android SDK</h2>

<p>
Install the Android SDK but do not install Eclipse (unless you want to). 
To avoid installing Eclipse, do not download the SDK bundle. 
Instead, download the <em>SDK for an existing IDE</em>.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
The standard IDE to use for developing Android applications is Eclipse.
However, Eclipse consumes a lot of memory and can run slowly on many computers. 
But Eclipse is not necessary because you can accomplish the same results 
using the command line interface to the Android SDK tools.
</p>

<p>
Do not locate the Android SDK inside your course repository.
In other words, do not store the SDK folder anywhere under <em>~/405</em>.
</p>

<p>
Modify your environment as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Set an environmental variable named ANDROID_SDK_HOME 
    that points to the location of the Android SDK on your system.
</li>
<li>Append ${ANDROID_SDK_HOME}/tools to your system path, 
    where ${ANDROID_SDK_HOME} is the folder location of the Android SDK on your system.
    Use %ANDROID_SDK_HOME%/tools if you are on Windows.
</li>
<li>Append ${ANDROID_SDK_HOME}/platform-tools to your system path. 
    Use %ANDROID_SDK_HOME%/platform-tools if you are on Windows.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Windows, you need to go through the Control Panel to set your environment. 
Alternatively, run a script each time you start a terminal session that makes the above settings. 
</p>

<p>
In OS X, you can accomplish the above by adding the following to <em>~/.bash_profile</em>. 
You should restart the terminal program to make sure these settings take effect.
</p>

<pre>
export ANDROID_SDK_HOME=$HOME/android-sdk-macosx
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_HOME/platform-tools
</pre>

<p>
The above configuration for OS X assumes 
that you located the Android SDK in your home directory. 
If you located it somewhere else, then adjust ANDROID_SDK_HOME accordingly.
</p>

<p>
If you're working from the lab computers, do the following instead:
</p>

<pre>
export ANDROID_SDK_HOME=$HOME
export PATH=$PATH:/share/android-sdks/tools
export PATH=$PATH:/share/android-sdks/platform-tools
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to restart your terminal session to make sure the new settings are loaded.
You might need to logout and log back in again.
</p>

<p>
Run the Android SDK Manager as follows.
</p>

<pre>
android sdk
</pre>

<p>
In the SDK manager window, install the Android SDK Tools, 
Android SDK Platform-tools, Android SDK Build-tools, 
and the most recent Android target (API 19 at the time of this writing). 
</p>

<h2>Set Up an Android Virtual Device</h2>

<p>
Run the Android Virtual Device Manager as follows.
</p>

<pre>
android avd
</pre>

<p>
Create a new virtual device to use for testing.
To make sure the emulator runs within the memory available on your computer,
define a virtual device that has low resource requirements, such as supporting a small screen, low RAM, etc.
Verify that you created a virtual device.
</p>

<pre>
android list avd
</pre>

<p>
Run the emulator with the AVD you created. 
Suppose that you named the virtual device <em>andy</em>.
Use the following to launch the emulator.
</p>

<pre>
emulator -avd andy
</pre>

<h2>Test your Web Application</h2>

<p>
This section explains how to test locally running Web servers
in the Android emulator and physical devices.
</p>

<p>
In the emulator, you can not reach your locally running Web application server through
<em>http://localhost:5000/</em> because the localhost
in the emulator is the emulated local machine 
and not the machine running the Web server.
To solve this problem, the Android emulator uses IP address <em>10.0.2.2</em> 
as a gateway to the localhost (loopback) interface of computer running the emulator.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, start your gift application server
and then browse to the following URL from within the emulator.
</p>

<pre>
http://10.0.2.2:5000/
</pre>

<p>
Because the emulator is slow, if you have a phone with a browser, 
it is probably better to test your Web pages with it.
If you are running the web application from you local computer,
you'll need to determine the IP address of your computer in order to navigate to it on your phone.
</p>

<p>
If you are at home, you are most likely on a private WiFi network. 
To reach your computer from your phone,
you'll need for your phone to be connected 
to the same Wifi network your computer is connected to.
Then, run <em>ipconfig</em> under Windows 
or <em>ifconfig</em> under OS X to discover your private IP address.
</p>

<p>
You may need to grant permission to node to bind to port 5000
and to allow outside connections to port 5000 for this to work.
How you do this depends on the security features in your environment.
</p>

<h2>Determine Build Target</h2>

<p>
These instructions assume that you have the most recent version of Android 
and it is <em>android-19</em>. 
To check this, run the following command.
</p>

<pre>
android list targets
</pre>

<p>
If you see a version of Android later than android-19, 
then use that in place of android-19 in these instructions.
</p>

<h2>Install Apache Ant</h2>

<p>
Ant is an Apache Foundation project 
that is widely used for building systems written in Java.
The Android SDK uses Ant.
For this reason, you need to have ant installed on your system 
to complete the remainder of this assignment.
</p>

<p>
Ant depends on the Java development kit (JDK).
Before installing ant, run the following command 
to see if the JDK is installed on your system.
</p>

<pre>
javac -version
</pre>

<p>
If the above command is not found, then you need to install the JDK. 
For this assignment and the remainder of the course, it is sufficient to install the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=JDK+SE">JDK Standard Edition (JDK SE)</a>.
I recommend that you install this version of the JDK.
</p>

<p>
After installing the JDK, use the following command
to verify that the Java compiler is runnable from the command line.
</p>

<pre>
javac -version
</pre>

<p>
Go to <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">the Apache Ant website</a>
and read a little of the documentation to get more familiar with it.
Download and install it.
</p>

<p>
Ant is a command line tool.
After installing Ant, use the following to check that you can run it
from the command line.
</p>

<pre>
ant -version
</pre>

<p>
If the command is not found you should try 2 things. 
First, close your terminal window 
and open a new terminal window to make sure your environment is current; 
then try the command again. 
Second, modify your system path to include a path to the ant executable. 
If you do this, make sure you close 
and reopen a terminal window to make sure the environment is current.
</p>

<p>
If the command is found, but ant complains about not finding something in a JDK, 
then create an environmental variable named JAVA_HOME 
that points to the location of the JDK folder in your system. 
After setting this environmental variable, 
close and reopen your terminal window to make sure the environment is current.
</p>

<h2>Learn About Ant</h2>

<p>
The ant command looks for a file with the name <em>build.xml</em> 
that contains build targets. 
If a default target is specified in <em>build.xml</em>, 
then ant will run it. 
To run a specific target, 
specify the name of the target as an argument to the ant command. 
To see how this works, create file <em>build.xml</em> with the following contents.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;project>
  &lt;target name="clean" description="Delete temp folder.">
    &lt;delete dir="temp" />
  &lt;/target>
&lt;/project>
</pre>

<p>
This build file contains a single target named <em>clean</em>,
which deletes a folder named <em>temp</em>.
Use the following command to run the clean target.
</p>

<pre>
ant clean
</pre>

<p>
<em>Clean</em> is a common target that is found in build files;
its purpose is to delete generated files, such as java class files.
</p>

<p>
To see a list of all targets in a build file, run the following.
</p>

<pre>
ant -projecthelp
</pre>

<p>
If you get a <em>command not found</em> message when you try to run ant,
it means that the folder containing the Ant executable is not 
in your system path.  To solve this problem, add this
folder to your system path.
</p>

<h2>Generate a Public-Private Key Pair</h2>

<p>
To install an Android application,
the installation file (apk file) needs to be signed.
Our build script will sign the apk file with the keys that we provide to it.
For this purpose, we will generate a key pair and self-signed certifcate.
Create file <em>~/405/mobile/android/gen-keystore.sh</em> with the following contents.
</p>

<pre>
keytool -genkey                 \
        -alias gift             \
        -keyalg RSA             \
        -keysize 2048           \
        -dname CN=localhost     \
        -keypass 123456         \
        -validity 10000         \
        -keystore gems.keystore \
        -storepass 123456
</pre>

<p>
If you are on Windows, the name the file <em>gen-keystore.bat</em>
and substiture the Unix line continuation character '\'
with the Windows line continuation character '^'.
</p>

<p>
In Linux and OS X, make the file executable with the following.
</p>

<pre>
chmod +x gen-keystore.sh
</pre>

<p>
Run the script and observe that a file named <em>gems.keystore</em>
was created.
This file contains your key pair and self-signed certificate.
</p>

<h2>Create a Traget to Create an Android Project</h2>

<p>
We will use Ant to generate an Android project as part of our build process
so that the Android project folder is a derived folder that is removed when we clean.
Because of this, we will not store any source code directly in the Android project folder.
</p>

<p>
The following target creates an Android project in the temp folder.
We use the name <em>gift</em> in preparation for the next assignment.
Add the following to your build file.
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;target name="create-proj" description="Create Android project">
    &lt;delete dir="temp/proj" />
    &lt;mkdir dir="temp" />
    &lt;exec executable="android" failonerror="true" os="Mac OS X">
      &lt;arg line="create project"           />
      &lt;arg line="--target android-19"      />
      &lt;arg line="--name gift"              />
      &lt;arg line="--activity MainActivity"  />
      &lt;arg line="--path temp/proj"         />
      &lt;arg line="--package app.gift"       />
    &lt;/exec>
  &lt;/target>
</pre>

<p>
Run the <em>create-proj</em> target and examine the output in the temp folder.
Run the <em>clean</em> target and observe that the temp folder is deleted.
</p>

<p>
The create-proj target generates a simple Android application
that we can compile, package and install in the emulator or actual Android device,
which we will do by defining and running new targets in the build script.
</p>

<h2>Create a Compile Target</h2>

<p>
The following target compiles the starter code that the create-proj target generates.
Add it to the build file.
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;target name="compile" description="Compile Java source code.">
    &lt;ant dir="temp/proj" target="release" inheritAll="false">
      &lt;property name="key.store" value="../../gems.keystore" />
      &lt;property name="key.alias" value="gift"                />
      &lt;property name="key.store.password" value="123456"     />
      &lt;property name="key.alias.password" value="123456"     />
    &lt;/ant>
  &lt;/target>
</pre>

<p>
Run the compile target and observe that <em>gift-release.apk</em>
gets generated in <em>temp/proj/bin</em>.
</p>

<h2>Create an Install Target</h2>

<p>
The following target installs the generated apk file
in the emulator or connected device.
Add this to your build file.
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;target name="install" description="Install apk in emulator or connected device.">
    &lt;ant dir="temp/proj" target="installr" inheritAll="false" />
  &lt;/target>
</pre>

<p>
Run the install target and verify that the app was installed and is runnable.
When the app runs, it should display "Hello World, MainActivity."
</p>

<h2>Configure Android Device for Testing</h2>

<p>
If you don't have an Android device, 
then you will need to use the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.
In this case, skip this section.
</p>

<p>
If you have an Android device that you can use for testing,
then configure your phone to test apps you are developing.
Depending on the version of Android that you are using,
you will do something like the following.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn on USB debugging.
    To do this, look under Settings ... Developer Options</li>
<li>Allow installation so apps from sources other than the Play Store.
    To do this, look under Settings ... Security.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable.
The cable will have a mini USB plug on one end for the phone
and a regular USB plug on the other end for the computer.
</p>

<p>
Try running the install target of your build script to see if the hello
world program installs to your phone.
If the Android emulator is running,
shut it down before attempting to install to a physically connected phone.
</p>

<p>
If you are on Windows and the system can not find the device, then read
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12827493">this comment</a>.
</p>

<h2>Add a Run Target</h2>

<p>
Add the following target to launch the installed app from the command line.
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;target name="run" description="Launch installed app.">
    &lt;exec executable="adb" dir="temp" failonerror="true">               
      &lt;arg line="shell am start -n app.gift/app.gift.MainActivity"  />  
    &lt;/exec>
  &lt;/target>
</pre>

<p>
Test the run target.
</p>

<h2>Add an All Traget to Run Multiple Targets</h2>

<p>
Add the following target to run all targets.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;target name="all" description="Build all.">
  &lt;antcall target="clean"       />
  &lt;antcall target="create-proj" />
  &lt;antcall target="compile"     />
  &lt;antcall target="install"     />
  &lt;antcall target="run"         />
&lt;/target>
</pre>

<p>
Test the new <em>all</em> target.
</p>

<p>
You can set a default target that ant will run
by specifying the target as the value of an attribute named <em>default</em>
in the root project element.
The following shows how to make the <em>all</em> target the project's default target.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;project default="all">
</pre>

<p>
To run the default target,
just run ant with no arguments.
</p>

<pre>
ant
</pre>

<h2>Add Derived Files to .gitignore</h2>

<p>
Derived files should not be added to your repository.
The build script that you created places all derived files under
the <em>temp</em> folder.
Add the following line to <em>~/405/.gitignore</em>
to tell git that you do not want to include this folder in the repository.
If this file does not yet exist, then create it.
</p>

<pre>
/ant/temp
/ant/gems.keystore
</pre>

<p>
We also include the generated keystore file
so that different developers can generate their own keystores.
Normally, separate keystores are generated development,
staging and production builds of an application.
</p>
